I've come through this means to introduce myself. Currently, I'm unemployed, but I have already participated in various projects. Such as: \n Development and maintenance of systems for 1000+ users in a large glass industry company using .NET Core, ASP.NET, AJAX, Razor, MySQL, GIT, Angular2+, and AngularJS. \n You can see the rest of the projects in the projects tab! \n I'm also taking some ongoing Angular courses, which I'm specializing in. \n In this spaceship, I wanted to play around with animations a bit and let my imagination flow, allowing me to create whatever I want. Anyway, welcome aboard and enjoy this journey!",
